				<p> Welcome to <strong>the fan site</strong> for our favorite character in the StarCraft 2
				series, Zeratul. A somewhat secretive and calculating character, Zeratul is nevertheless a venerable
				and wise leader who is honorable and loyal to his species. He would gladly risk anything to safeguard Aiur.
				During the Great War, Zeratul allied with the Khalai Tassadar, despite his hatred for the Protoss Conclave 
				that once banished his forebears. During the dire events leading up to the evacuation of Aiur, he also convinced
				 the Khalai Protoss that his brethren, the Dark Templar, would be more welcoming of sheltering their estranged 
				 brethren in their lightless homeworld Shakuras in contrast to the consistently hostile attitudes of the 
				 Conclave towards his people. He knows that though he is scorned by the very same people who look to him for 
				 salvation, he is aware of what must be done to save the universe, and must still lead his people to salvation. 
				  The two leaders (and Jim Raynor) came to an understanding, joined forces and hid from the Zerg. He often 
				  speaks in riddles, preferring that others come up with the answers to the questions he puts forward rather than answering them himself.
				The discovery of the hybrids, led Zeratul to take a more active role once again.

			<h3>Auir</h3>
			<p>Aiur is a huge world located on the fringes of the Milky Way Galaxy, home to the Protoss. 
			It was engineered by the xel'naga and left to itself for a long period of time. When the xel'naga returned,
			 they discovered the Protoss on the world. They guided Protoss evolution, as a result, they were forced to flee,
			  and the Protoss fell into a racial madness-fueled conflict called the Aeon of Strife. Aiur was devastated 
			  in the Aeon of Strife but after the period ended, it began to steadily recover.

			<h3>History of the SC Franchise</h3>
			<p>StarCraft features three races: the renegade human terrans, the noble psionic protoss,
			 and the horrific insectoid zerg. The storyline covers the fortunes of these three races and 
			 their leaders, fighting for dominance in a remote region of the galaxy. Typically, the player's 
			 race makes gains during an episode, but never completely conquers the other races.  The story 
			 continues to this day with the release of SC2 : Wings of Liberty and SC2: Heart of the Swarm.
