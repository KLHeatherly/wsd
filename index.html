			<h2>Auir</h2>
			<p>Aiur is a huge world located on the fringes of the Milky Way Galaxy, home to the Protoss. 
			It was engineered by the xel'naga and left to itself for a long period of time. When the xel'naga returned,
			 they discovered the Protoss on the world. They guided Protoss evolution, as a result, they were forced to flee,
			  and the Protoss fell into a racial madness-fueled conflict called the Aeon of Strife. Aiur was devastated 
			  in the Aeon of Strife but after the period ended, it began to steadily recover.

			<h3>History of the SC Franchise</h3>
			<p>StarCraft features three races: the renegade human terrans, the noble psionic protoss,
			 and the horrific insectoid zerg. The storyline covers the fortunes of these three races and 
			 their leaders, fighting for dominance in a remote region of the galaxy. Typically, the player's 
			 race makes gains during an episode, but never completely conquers the other races.  The story 
			 continues to this day with the release of SC2 : Wings of Liberty and SC2: Heart of the Swarm.
